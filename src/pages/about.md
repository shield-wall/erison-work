Hello Hello,

I'm Erison Silva and I've been working in the past 10 years as Software developer.

## üìã Resume

Here you can download my last [resume](https://bucket.myprofile.pro/users/eerison/resume-default.pdf) version.

## ‚ô•Ô∏è Open Source

Open source has been a topic that I always want to be be involved, and in Octuber 2020 I did my first Pull request for [Sonata User Bundle][first_pr_sonata_user]!
and Since there I ejoyed more and more contribute with OSS projects, Thanks Sonata Project for be so receptive and helpfull in my first contribuition <3.

### Myprofile project

[Myprofile][myprofile_project], It is a open source project mantained by me, and I will dedicate a article just for this, it commes soon.

### Sonata page bundle 4

This new major was one of the most exited contribution that I have a plasure to be part of, everything started since one of the last companies that I worked uses this bundle and it was stuck on symfony version 4, and I pushed foword the initiative to relase the new major version.

It was a really huge amount of work and it toke aound 4 months the have this released, and I have learned a lot, maybe thing that I never learn in any company.
You can see this long effort in this [issue][sonata_page_bundle_4_issue]

> a special thank you for [Vincent Langlet][vincent_github] and [Jordi Sala Morales][jordi_gthub], for all support that you gave me.

### Rector phpunit

Rector is another php community really friendly, I started to contribute with this project since I was working in a phpunit upgrade, and I faced some code that I need to refactor manually and it was a pain, then I introduce a rule to make this automatic and I've adding more rules to help me with this automatic refactor.

> Thank you ractor for this amazing project, it is a really good example that community works <3
