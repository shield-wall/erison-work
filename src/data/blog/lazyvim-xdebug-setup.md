## Table of contents

## Requirements

- [Lazyvim][lazyvim] / neovim
- [Ansible][ansible]
- Docker compose

> This article is based on my [lazyvim](https://github.com/eerison/lazyvim) and [.dotenv][dotenv] repositories.

## Setup

### Clone the .dotenv repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/eerison/.dotfiles.git
```
### Run the ansible playbook
```bash
ansible-playbook -i hosts playbook.yaml -t lazyvim -t php
```
### Configure xdebug in your docker compose

Copy the [compose.override.yaml][compose-yaml] file into your project directory:
```bash
cp ~/.config/nvim-external/xdebug-config/compose.override.yaml ./<your-project-path>
```

> After you copy the file above, restart your containers.

### Configuration notes

- Your docker work directory must be `/app`, If itâ€™s different, update it in the [php.lua][php-config] file.
- `compose.override.yaml` overrides the [app][app-container] container. If your container has a different name, update the override file accordingly.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues, try the following options:

### Telnet

Check if you can connect on `9003` port using Telnet, you should see:
```
telnet localhost 9003

# Trying 127.0.0.1...
# Connected to localhost.
# Escape character is '^]'.
```
> type `Ctrl + ]` and then `close` to close telnet connection.

### Enable logs in Lua config
To debug more deeply, enable logging in the `php.lua` config file.
```diff
          type = "php",
          request = "launch",
          name = "Listen for Xdebug",
+         log = true,
          port = 9003,
```
